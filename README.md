# WebAppForCommandLineUtils
This is a web app used to create a web interface for command line utils. The goal of this project is to make complex command line tools accessible. 

# How to use
This project uses npx serve to quickly serve static files (like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) using [`serve`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) via `npx`, **without installing anything globally**.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) must be installed on your machine. You can verify this by running:

  ```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```

- If Node.js is not installed download it from https://nodejs.org and install it before proceeding.

## Running the application
- Call npx serve and click on either the local link or network both work!
- Then use the interface to customize how you want your client form to look
- Once completed click "Create Webpage" 
- The downloaded file is the UI for the client to access the command line interface without any need of knowledge on how use command line tools!
